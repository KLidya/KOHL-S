Test Plan for https://myomealsprep.com/:

1. Test Scope:
   - This test plan encompasses testing the search functionality, sign-up process, and adding items to the cart on the MyoMeals's website.
   - Testing will be conducted using TestNG as the testing framework, katalon as the test automation tool, 
     and Selenium for web automation, all integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration.

2. Test Objectives:
   - Ensure that the search functionality accurately retrieves relevant results.
   - Validate the sign-up process by ensuring users can successfully create accounts.
   - Verify that items can be added to the cart without errors.

3. Test Environment:
   - Operating System: Windows 10
   - Browsers: Chrome
   - Test Automation Tools: TestNG, Katalon, Selenium, Cucumber
   - CI/CD Integration: Jenkins

4. Test Cases:

   Search Functionality:
   - TC1: Verify that a search query returns relevant results.
   - TC2: Ensure the search functionality handles various input formats (text, numbers, special characters) gracefully.
   - TC3: Verify the pagination functionality if search results exceed a single page.

   Sign-up Process:
   - TC4: Verify that users can navigate to the sign-up page.
   - TC5: Ensure all required fields are validated during sign-up.
   - TC6: Validate the email verification process after sign-up.

   - TC8: Ensure the cart updates correctly when items are added.
   - TC9: Verify that users can remove items from the cart.

5. Test Data:
   - Generate test data for sign-up process including valid and invalid email addresses, passwords, and user information.
   - Use sample search queries for testing search functionality.

6. Test Execution:
   - Create test scripts using katalon Studio, utilizing Selenium WebDriver for web automation.
   - Implement test scripts using TestNG to organize and execute tests.
   - Integrate the test suite with Jenkins for automated execution triggered by code changes.

7. Reporting and Analysis:
   - Generate detailed test execution reports using TestNG and katalon Studio.
   - Analyze test results for failures and defects, categorizing them based on severity and priority.
   - Utilize Jenkins' reporting capabilities for tracking test execution trends over time.

8. Risks and Mitigation:
   - Risks: Changes in the website's structure or functionality may impact test automation scripts.
   - Mitigation: Regular maintenance of automation scripts to adapt to website changes promptly. Implement version control for test scripts to track changes.

9. Dependencies:
   - Ensure compatibility of testing tools with the latest browser versions.
   - Regularly update dependencies such as Selenium WebDriver and browser drivers to prevent compatibility issues.

10. Conclusion:
    - This test plan outlines comprehensive testing of critical functionalities on the MyoMeals's website using TestNG, 
      Katalon, Selenium, Cucumber and Jenkins integration. By following this plan, we ensure the reliability and stability of the website's core features,
